## Hello, school kids
I hate schooling, such a pain in my a\*\*

Just started this profile out of hating the books and those stupid a\*\* PDFs. honestly idk if I'll keep up to this content

Anyways, here I wish to upload and contribute stuff related to schools (in India mainly, coz I'm from India, duh) to help boost others performance (mainly mine coz idgaf bout others but public so others can contribute as well, maybe a win-win for both me and all of you :P)

Here are some rules for contribution:
1. Content must be in the simplest form of English language for everyone to understand.
2. Content must be in proper order of learning to fill every gap.
3. Complex stuff should be broken down into simpler parts, and put hyperlinks on them to their respective lesson/notes.
4. Content can be humourous, but must not contain vulgar language.
5. Content must be fact-checked and true
